# Project: The Flu

## ABOUT

The Flu is a single player game, where the player can jump and shoot at “mega germs.” There are multiple types of germs, with corresponding motion and lives. The player can jump on germs to kill them or shoot them with “antidotes” they have collected. When the player comes in contact with a germ when not jumping, the player loses a life. When a germ is shot, its life count decreases. When its life count reaches zero, it is effectively killed. The screen is shifting upward at a constant speed, and if the player falls or crosses the red line at the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life. The player has three lives.

 There are three levels with increasing difficulty
